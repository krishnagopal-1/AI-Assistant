Project Overview
This repository contains a simple, interactive AI Assistant web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by Google's Gemini API for intelligent text generation. Users can chat with the AI directly in the browser, leveraging generative AI for a wide range of questions and answers.

Features
Conversational AI Chat: Type your questions or prompts and get instant, intelligent responses from the Gemini model.

Responsive, Clean UI: Built with modern web technologies for smooth user experience.

Easy API Key Integration: Designed so anyone can use their own Gemini API key to run the app securely.

How to Use
Clone this repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
Obtain a Gemini API Key:

Go to Google AI Studio and follow instructions to create a free API key. You’ll need to sign in with your Google account and accept terms.

Add the API Key:

At the top of the script.js file (or wherever your JS handles Gemini API calls), you’ll see a variable named apiKey. Set its value to your own API key, for example:

js
const apiKey = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE';
Save the file.

Run Locally:

Open index.html in your browser. You can now interact with the AI Assistant!

Security Notice
This project is intended for learning and personal use. Never share your API key publicly or commit it to public repositories. The app is set up so your key is never included by default—each user must supply their own.
